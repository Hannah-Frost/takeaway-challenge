# Takeaway Challenge #

  This program replicates a takeaway delivery service (specifically the online aspect of ordering food from a menu).

  I approached this challenge by using TDD and debugging with Rspec tests to reach my final version. I wrote out a Rspec test that described my aim and then followed the error messages to create source-code that corresponded to those errors.

  It acts as practice for my Ruby and Rspec skills, as well as introducing new skills (such as using Twilio to send texts using my code).

## What criteria should this program satisfy?
  - Prints the menu.
  - Ability to select food from the menu.
  - Check that the given total matches the sum of selected food.
  - Sends a text thanking you for your placed order, with delivery time attached.
